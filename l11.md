# Unit Testing

## Terminology

**Unit test**: one or more *unit under test* (UUT)

**Input data**: All input, including implicit argument (The instance that receives the method call)

**UUT** (or assertion): a piece of code we wish to test in isolation

**Oracle**: the correct result for execution of a UUT

ex: 
```
Math.abs(-5) == 5
```
-5: input data

5: oracle

## Benefits of unit testing

1. Detect new bugs in code
2. Make sure that the old code that used to meet a certain specification still meets that specification after code change (ex: testing a rewritten method)
3. Detect important corner cases

**exhaustive testing**: Testing all possible inputs for a UUT. Almost impossible and impractical because the source code is always changing.

> Passing the test does not guarantee that the code is correct!
Unit testing cannot verify code to be correct since it can only verify a specific execution of the code to be correct.


## Basic testing principles

- Fast: unit tests are run often, so they need to be completed quickly
- Independent: Each test should be able to execute in isolation without depending on another test leaving the object in a certain state
- Repeatable: Same result in different environments (ex: difference OS, environment-specific properties, etc)
- Focused: The test should only verify a specific and narrow execution. If a test is too complex then it's not easy to determine what went wrong if it fails.
- Readable: The test should be easy to read with good names, easy to identify input data and oracle, evident assertion statements

## Stub

A simplified version of a complex object to test a UUT (heavily dependant on polymorphism)

## Test coverage

The challence of test cases is to select problems to test efficiently, since it's impossible to test all possible inputs. Ways to approach testing:

- Functional (black box) testing: cover the specified behavior of a UUT based on external specification of what it should do. Good for revealing problems with specification and missing logic
- Structural (white box) testing: cover the implemented behavior of the UUT based on source code. Good for revealing problems caused by low-level implementation (ex: testing different parts of a if else statement).
> Do not test for unspecified behavior or inputs that does not meet a method's precondition

### Statement coverage

Coverage metrics that measures coverage by the amount of statements executed in the test. Not practical because some statements are more complex than others.

### Branch coverage (better)

Coverage metric that measures the amount of decision points (branches) executed (ex: if else has 2 branches, executing the if part covers 1 branch). More of the possible program executions can be tested this way.

### Metaprogramming

Use metaprogramming to make fields accessible. Mostly used for testing private attributes.
