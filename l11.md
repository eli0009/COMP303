# Unit Testing

## Terminology

**Unit test**: one or more *unit under test* (UUT)

**Input data**: All input, including implicit argument (The instance that receives the method call)

**UUT** (or assertion): a piece of code we wish to test in isolation

**Oracle**: the correct result for execution of a UUT

for the following UUT: 
```
Math.abs(-5) == 5
```
-5: input data

5: oracle

## Benefits of unit testing

1. Detect new bugs in code
2. Make sure that the old code that used to meet a certain specification still meets that specification after code change (ex: testing a rewritten method)
3. Detect important corner cases

**exhaustive testing**: Testing all possible inputs for a UUT. Almost impossible and impractical because the source code is always changing.

Unit testing cannot verify code to be correct since it can only verify a specific execution of the code to be correct.
