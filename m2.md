# Types and Interfaces

## Polymorphism

Interface allows any objects with the required methods to use a piece of code. Implementing an interface makes the class a subtype of the interface.

See [Polymorphism.java](code/Polymorphism.java). Using `List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();` instead of `ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();` is a good practice because it gives you the flexibility to, for example, use a LinkedList instead.

## Factory

A factory is simply a method whose role is to create and return an object. Several of the following design patterns rely on this concept.

See [Factory.java](code/Factory.java), they can allow multiple constructor with same parameter but with more descriptive method header.

## Iterator and Iterable

Implement `Iterable <T>` in your class which returns an interator. An iterator is an implementation of `Iterator<T>` (See inner class)

See [IterUse.java](code/IterUse.java). 

## ITERATOR design pattern

The purpose is to provide access to a collection of encapsulated object without exposing the underlying representation.

See [IterPattern.java](code/IterPattern.java)  The best way to use Iterable is to return the Iterator implementation of the data structure (ex: ArrayList)

## STRATEGY design pattern

Goal: allow switching algorithm.

An example of the strategy design pattern is `Collection.sort()` which allows the client to use a custom comparison algorithm.

See [Strategy.java](code/Strategy.java). You can either sort the items by name or by price.

### Dependency Injection

Strategy design pattern where the strategy is an interface which the client is responsible for implementing.

## Interface segragation principle

Client should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not need. An interface should only contain methods that are often used together.
