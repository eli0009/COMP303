# Classes and interface

## Minimize accessibility

Classes and members should be as inaccessible as possible, because this allows us to test components in isolation. A class or member that is not private is part of the API and must be supported forever.

## Accessor methods instead of public fields

Accessor methods (getters and setters) are better than allowing access to a field directly because you can change the internal representation without changing the API

## Minimize mutabiilty

Rules to make class immutable:

1. Make fields private and final
2. Don't provide setters
3. Prevent class extending (make class final)
4. Prevent access to reference of mutable components

Benefits of immutable objects:

- They are thread-safe, require no synchronization
- Can be shared freely
- Great building blocks for other objects
