# Inheritance

## Inheritance

Inheritance is when a class (subclass) extends another class (superclass), this is different from implementing an interface:

1. A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, nested classes). 
2. A class can only extend one class, but can implement multiple interface
3. A subclass inherits all implementation details of the methods, but an interface doesn't


## Downcast

Downcast to subclass when using a method not in the superclass. May result in runtime exception if casted to the wrong subclass.

See [Downcast.java](code/Downcast.java)

## Abstract Class

Abstract classes are useful for creating a structured hierarchy of related classes while interfaces are useful for defining flexible behavious.
The main advantage of abstract class is that it can provide a default implementation of some or all of its methods, which reduces duplicate code

Default methods in interface cannot use fields, but methods implemented in abstract classes can use fields.

See [AbstractClass.java](code/AbstractClass.java)

## TEMPLATE METHOD design pattern

Similar to strategy design pattern, but we use abstract class and inheritance instead:
1. Create abstract class that contains an implemented method that uses abstract methods
2. Create subclass that inherit abstract class. The subclass then implement the abstract methods according to their need. The abstract class is the strategy

See [abstract method of AbstractClass.java](code/AbstractClass.java)

## Liskov Substitution Principle

An object of the superclass must be replaceable with an object of its subclass without breaking the application. Basic rules:

1. Don't implement stricter validation rules on input parameters
2. Don't throw new exception
3. Don't introduce side effects that are not part of the superclass
4. Don't return a less specific type (you can return a subtype of the promised type, but not a more generalized type)

Consider replacing the superclass with an interface if you are breaking this principle.
