# Inversion of Control

## GUI using JavaFX on VSCodium

To run applications that use JavaFX library, add the JavaFX library to your project and add the following debug configuration to `launch.json` with the correct path to module.
```
{
    "type": "java",
    "name": "Current File",
    "request": "launch",
    "mainClass": "${file}",
    "vmArgs": "--module-path /home/user/javafx-sdk/lib/ --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml"
},
```

See [JavafxGUI.java](code/JavafxGUI.java) for a simple application using JavaFX.

## OBSERVER design pattern

Observer is used for alerting changes in data (typically the value of a field of an object). To use:
1. Create an observer interface with the method `update()`

2. Create an observable interface with the methods `addObserver(Observer)`, `notifyObservers()`, and a method for getting the field that we want to monitor

3. Create an observable class that implements the observable interface. 
    - Create field `ArrayList<Observer>` to store the observers. 
    - Implement `notifyObservers()` which simply loops over the arraylist and call `update()` on each element
    - Create a field of interest that we want to monitor (ex: number of files)
    - Add `notifyObservers()` at the end of any method that changes the value of that field (ex: adding files). __Do not notify if value did not change__

4. Create observer class that implements the observer interface. Its constructor accepts an observable, and adds itself to the observable
    - Implement `update()` which simply gets the field of the observable and do something

See [Observer.java](code/Observer.java)

### Push data-flow strategy for observer

The update(data) method has a parameter through which the observable subject sends data. Used when data size is small and observer needs real-time update

The observable interface doesn't need to provide methods to access data as it sends it through the update(data) method parameter

### Pull data-flow strategy for observer

The update() method has no parameter. The observer needs to query the data through methods. Used when data size is big and observer doesn't need real-time update.

The observable interface needs a method for querying the observed data.

## VISITOR design pattern

Visitor is useful when you have many subclass with different properties that each need different algorithm. It allows separation of the class from the algorithms and makes it easy to add new algorithm without modifying the class. To use:
1. Create visitor interface with method `visit(Subclass)` for each subclass
2. Create abstract superclass with a `accept(Visitor)` abstract method
3. Create multiple subclasses that will implement the abstract method with the body `visitor.visit(this)`
4. Create visitor class that implements the visitor interface. Each method is for a different subclass
